AttAttach is a python library for generating the attractor landscape of a Boolean network with given number and types of attractors.

The attractor landscape of the deterministic dynamics of a Boolean network with $n$ dynamic nodes possesses the folowing properties:
1) It is a directed graph with $2^n$ nodes (states of the Boolean network);
2) The out degree of each of its nodes is equal to 1.
